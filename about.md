# About

As a web developer and graduate of Queen's University with a Bachelor of Computing, I look for opportunities to compliment my passion for innovation and technology. While at Queen's University I was actively involved in campus life and student-run organizations. Notably, in my final year, I served as the Marketing Director of [QHacks](https://qhacks.io/)., a student-organized 500 person hackathon.

I have experience working on various stages of the software development lifecycle as a Quality Assurance Engineer at [ScribbleLive](https://en.rockcontent.com/) and [ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/en-ca/) and most recently in Product Support at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/canada/index.html). I am currently a student at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/), in a 12-week immersive full-stack web development boot camp program specializing in Javascript, HTML/CSS, SQL, React, and Ruby/Ruby on Rails. With my upcoming graduation from the program, I am looking to gain more development experience working as a full-stack developer.

I love to travel and cook and run a food blog in my spare time on Instgram [@juliaeatzworld](https://www.instagram.com/juliaeatzworld/).
